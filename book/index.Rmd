## What is this book? {-}

This is the online version of __The STRAF Book__, which is currently under
active development. It is dedicated to the STRAF software, a web application
for the analysis of genetic data in forensics practice.

## Forensic and population genetics, lost sisters {-}

Genetics has many faces, and forensic and population genetics are two of them.
If we were to summarise their respective scopes, we could say that the former 
applies genetics to legal matters, and the latter is focusing on understanding 
genetic differences within and between populations, a fundamental matter in 
evolutionary biology.

Forensic genetics and population genetics have always been two tightly linked
disciplines. Why is that? Because most questions are shared between disciplines.
Problems in forensics and population genetics seem different, same problem
phrased differently.

Software and metrics developed in the population genetics field are used in 
routine in forensic genetics practice. But forensics is not just "applied population genetics". Such a speicfic field of application, given the legal implications
and the unique situations (data types and acquisition, unique challenges),
that it also required the development of specific metrics.

## And then there was STRAF {-}

STRAF was born from the encounter of two scientists: a forensic geneticist and
a population geneticist. In 2017, in Bern, Switzerland, Martin Zieger came to 
visit a population genetics lab, where Alexandre Gouy was pursuing his PhD thesis at that time.

Analysing a dataset using scripts I had developed for the analysis of STR / 
microsatellite data. We don't event name our markers the same way, though we 
are doing the exact same thing: genotyping samples, controlling the quality of
our data, computing relevant metrics about our markers, and investigating the
relationship between populations and individuals.

On the forensics side. These forensic parameters were computed using a that has 
been provided by one of the companies providing assays, the mythical PowerStats v1.2
spreadsheet, allowing to compute forensic statistics and allele frequencies in 
Microsoft Excel. It has been since then removed from the Internet, and forensic 
geneticists started sharing this spreadsheet among each other, circulating 
almost secretly, "under the cloak" as French speakers would say.

A few weeks later, STRAF was born, and after four year, STRAF had become a useful to the forensics community, but not only. It has been used as a support for teaching 
population genetics, and has been used in evolutionary biology studies. 
The positive reception of the software in the community motivated its 
development over the years until the release of STRAF 2.0 in 2021. 

STRAF's story highlights the importance of communication between fields.

## What will you learn? {-}

By reading this book, our hope is that you will:

* Get an overview of concepts forensic and populaation genetics

* Learn how to use the STRAF software for STR data analysis through practical 
applications

* Be able to interpret common metrics and analyses used in forensics practice

## Outline {-}

The book is organised as follow:

* We'll start by an introduction to essential forensic and population genetics concepts.

* In Chapter 1, focus on data. Which data are we dealin

* In Chapter 2, we will review forensic parameters

* In Chapter 3, Population genetics indices

* In Chapter 4, we will focus on multivariate statistics and how they can provide 
insights into population structure, with a particular focus on Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), two widely used approaches in genetics.

* In Chapter 5, we gather recommendations around potential next analysis steps
by presenting STRAF's file conversion capabilities and useful methods implemented in
other software.
