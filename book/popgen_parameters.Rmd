# Population genetics indices

## Population genetics concepts

* Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

* Population structure

## Indices

* Heterozygosities

* F-statistics

* FST


:::note
__One concept, multiple estimators.__

Several __estimators__ of Fst exist (for example, Weir and Cockerham's, Nei's, 
Hudson's FST). It's like if each population geneticist decided to develop their
own estimator! Why is that? In statistics, what we call an __estimator__
is. It is important to keep in mind that these estimators rely on a specific __model__,
with underlying assumptions. It explains why some estimators are more or less reliable
depending on the case and observed data, and each of them has been developed for 
a different situation.
