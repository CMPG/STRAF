__Inut file checklist__

* Check input parameters in the sidebar: do they actually correspond to the input data?
* Check locus names: are they all different for haploid data? Do both columns for a single locus for diploid data have the exact same name?
* Check that all missing data have been encoded with a "0"
* Try to remove any special characters from sample and locus names
* Check for the presence of empty spaces at the end of each line
* Check if alleles are exclusively encoded with numbers
* Check if values are separated by tabs and not spaces
* Check if the first two columns are names "ind" and "pop"
