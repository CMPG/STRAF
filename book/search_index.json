Software and metrics developed in the population genetics field are used in routine in forensic genetics practice. STRAF was born from the encounter of a forensic geneticist and a population geneticist. In 2017, in Bern, Switzerland, Martin Zieger came to visit a population genetics lab. Alexandre was doing his PhD thesis in the lab at that time. A few weeks later, STRAF was born. Analysing a dataset using scripts I had developed for the analysis of STR / microsatellite data. We dont event name our markers the same way, though we are doing the exact same thing: genotyping samples, controlling the quality of our data, computing relevant metrics about our markers, and investigating the relationship between populations and individuals. STRAFs story highlights the importance of communication between fields. Why read this book? Coming soon.
